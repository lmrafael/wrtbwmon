# What is it ? #

A small shell script designed to run on linux powered routers (OpenWRT, DD-WRT, Tomato, and  other routers where shell access is available). It provides per user bandwidth monitoring capabilities and generates usage reports.

# How do I use it ? #
Please have a look at this wiki page : http://code.google.com/p/wrtbwmon/wiki/Deploying

# Alternatives #
wrtbwmon is not actively developed anymore. I invite you to consider these alternative projects :
  1. The [tomatousb guys](http://www.linksysinfo.org/index.php?forums/tomato-firmware.33/) have done an awesome job at integrating its functionality into the tomato firmware and have taken it way beyond anything I could have dreamed of. Look for the IP traffic monitoring features in [Toastman](http://www.4shared.com/dir/v1BuINP3/Toastman_Builds.html), [Shibby](http://tomato.groov.pl/) or [Teaman](http://code.google.com/p/tomato-sdhc-vlan/) latest builds !
  1. [Gargoyle router](http://www.gargoyle-router.com/) also has a quota management system.
